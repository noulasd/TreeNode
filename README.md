# TreeNode
a BST dictionary in Java

I made this to sharpen my skills in Java and data structures. It's also the 2019 data structures 2nd assignment at University of Piraeus from where I graduated.

The assignment required inserting, finding and deleting words (or nodes in general) as well as printing the whole tree in such a way that every root is above and to the left of its right subtree and respectively above and to the right of its left subtree. This  was also required with the least amount of underscores (or spaces) as possible.

For simplicity every node corresponds to the first letter of its word.

example:

   d        
  d   i 
b    g   l  
 b  d  j   s
        l l
